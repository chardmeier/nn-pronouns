**Matlab implementation of neural network for cross-lingual pronoun prediction**

_Christian Hardmeier_

This is the Matlab implementation of my neural network code for cross-lingual pronoun prediction.
The only part of interest is the `nn6` directory. It contains the code that
was used for the experiments in Chapters 8 and 9 of my 
[PhD thesis](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-223798) and in the following
papers:

This code is provided for reference only. I do not recommend that you try to use it for anything.
Contact me to discuss better options if you're interested in trying out my models.
